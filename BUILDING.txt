#1 Dependencies
-> Qt 5.1 (core gui widgets sql)

#2 General
The KapCompta.pro is the qmake master file,
If you want to add extra plugins to your project, add their directories
as subdir of KCPlugin/ and list them in the KCPlugin.pro file.
The KCHousing.pro shows an example to automatically install the plugin
and link it to the shared lib.

#3 Platform specific notes
-- Mac OSX
In order to build the bundle, you need to add a deploy step which executes
the 'osx_shared_lib.sh' script. Be sure it has the execution flag set (chmod +x).
Execute it from the Build directory (or update it and commit it :D)

-- Windows
You will probably have to add the shared lib to the $PATH but I haven't tested yet

-- Linux
You will probably have to add the shared lib to the $LD_LIBRARY_PATH ; haven't tested either

#4 Plugins
Plugins will be auto-detected/loaded if they are in the plugins subdirectory of the
KCApp build dir.

#5 Translations
Compiled versions of the translation files (obtained with `lrelease somefile.ts`) must
 be placed in the plugins dir as well in order to be loaded by the app.
Running lupdate from times to time shouldn't be a luxury ...
